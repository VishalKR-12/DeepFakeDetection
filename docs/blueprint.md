# **App Name**: DeepDetect

## Core Features:

- DeepFake Analysis: AI-powered analysis tool: Process input videos to determine if they are deepfakes. Uses a combination of CNNs, RNNs, and frequency analysis to identify inconsistencies.
- Detailed Report: Report Generation: Create a detailed report outlining the analysis process, including detected abnormalities, potential methods used in the deep fake creation, and a confidence score. Tool determines the method of deepfake generation using an LLM.
- Video Input: Video Upload and Processing: Allow users to upload videos for analysis. Supports various video formats and automatically queues videos for processing.
- Result Visualization: Display Analysis Results: Show a user-friendly display of the analysis results. Highlight key indicators of deepfake presence with clear visual cues and explanations.
- Performance tracking: Implement performance metrics tracking to log accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#0074B7) to convey trust and reliability, reflecting the app's purpose in combating misinformation.
- Background color: Light Gray (#60A3D9), which provides a clean and neutral backdrop, ensuring that the analytical data stands out. The use of this lightness is critical to avoid eye strain in prolonged usage.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#BFD7ED) highlights critical analysis points and interactive elements. This vibrant hue grabs user attention immediately, underscoring the importance of identified information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clarity and readability, is selected to ensure a user-friendly reading experience when reviewing deepfake analyses.
- Utilize sharp, precise icons to represent different analysis types and abnormalities. The use of the icon set Feather ensures these remain crisp and distinct even when scaled, thereby enabling users to quickly distinguish various functionalities within the interface.
- Implement a clear, hierarchical layout that prioritizes the video analysis display and report access. Structure information intuitively, enabling the user to quickly scan the analysis details. Adopt a tile layout where different pieces of information are represented inside individual, rectangular 'tiles', thus greatly improving readability
- Subtle animations when loading analysis reports to communicate status. During analysis, the interface gives the illusion of the system running; consider small 'updating' notes
